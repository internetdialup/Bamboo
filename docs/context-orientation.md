# Documentation.md — Context Orientation

The running per-Knob log for this repository. Each Bump (commit, version push, state transition) earns a one-to-two paragraph summary with date and timestamp. Brief, concrete, no bloat. Any agent (or human) reading this file should be able to trace what happened at any Knob in the repo's history and why.

When this file crosses 5000 characters of per-Knob entries, spawn `context-ori-summary-2.md` and continue here. Then `-3.md`, `-4.md`, `-5.md` as the repo grows. The current Knob and the last three stay hot in this file. Older entries migrate to the numbered summary files as cold storage.

Read in reverse chronological order — newest at the top. The active Knob is whatever appears first.

## Knob: memory Skills + map hygiene — Thursday, May 28, 2026, 07:52 PM CDT

Added two separate Skills instead of bloating `repo-cognition`: `memory-context` for Knob-aware retrieval, ADM/RAG alignment, hot/warm/cold memory, and handoffs; `memory-watchdog` for stale maps, broken references, missing Knob entries, duplicate concepts, and memory rot. Updated `skills/skill-map.md` so Skills are now mapped instead of living behind a stub.

Added Map Hygiene rules to `docs/repo-organization.md`. New folders, moved files, new Skills, and new architecture memory docs now have explicit map-update expectations. This is the OSS governance edge of the repo: if the map lies, the memory system rots.

## Knob: ADM/RAG memory folder — Thursday, May 28, 2026

Moved the memory architecture docs into `architecture/memory/` so Memory, Drift, Watchdog, ADM, RAG, and CRUD live in one place instead of scattering across the top of `architecture/`. `workflow-tools.md` stays directly under `architecture/` because it is about tool friction and workflow surfaces, not the memory store itself.

Added the first pass of ADM, RAG, and CRUD memory docs. ADM carries episodic chapters and active memory banks. RAG carries semantic and procedural memory. CRUD is the keep-it-alive loop so stale memory gets created, read, updated, or destroyed instead of quietly rotting.

## Knob: architecture map + PLTRF cleanup — Thursday, May 28, 2026, 06:53 PM CDT

Added `architecture/` to the repo's cold-start map as the fifth working folder. It now shows up in `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/repo-organization.md`, but it is selective cold-start material. Agents load it when memory itself is the work: drift, Watchdog, audits, workflow governance, or memory architecture. Otherwise it stays cold so the Token budget does not get eaten just because a folder exists.

Cleaned up early PLTRF drift before it became normal. Fixed the broken `references/context-token-limits.md` pointers, corrected the long-term preservation acronym split, synced the repo-cognition reference mirrors back to canonical `behavior/`, and turned the Codex/Claude/Gemini overlays into thin wrappers around `SKILL.md`. Same hooks, fewer duplicated rules, less chance the repo becomes the thing the agent fights.

Older entries moved to `docs/context-ori-summary-2.md` as cold storage. Pull that file only when the current Knob references older scaffolding or prior release history.
